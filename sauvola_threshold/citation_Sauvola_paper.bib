abstract = {A new method is presented for adaptive document image binarization, where the page is considered as a collection of subcomponents such as text, background and picture. The problems caused by noise, illumination and many source type-related degradations are addressed. Two new algorithms are applied to determine a local threshold for each pixel. The performance evaluation of the algorithm utilizes test images with ground-truth, evaluation metrics for binarization of textual and synthetic images, and a weight-based ranking procedure for the final result presentation. The proposed algorithms were tested with images including different types of document components and degradations. The results were compared with a number of known techniques in the literature. The benchmarking results show that the method adapts and performs well in each case qualitatively and quantitatively.}
